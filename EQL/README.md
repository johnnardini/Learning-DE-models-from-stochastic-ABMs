# Equation learning (EQL)

## Code to run equation learning from ABM data. 

The EQL tutorial can be run from EQL Tutorial.ipynb

Each case study can be run from the individual case study jupyter notebooks. 

The code for equation learning is found in PDEFind_class_online.py and PDE_FIND3.py.

Helpful functions for DE model simulation are found in model_selection_IP3.pu
