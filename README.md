# Learning DE models for stochastic ABMs
 Code for "Learning differential equation models from stochastic agent-based model simulations," available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08255 .
 
 The folders correspond to code for ABM simulation in ABM, DE Model Learning in EQL, and pre-saved data for the case studies in data.
